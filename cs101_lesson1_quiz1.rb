# Write Python code that prints out Udacity (with a capital U), 
# given the definition of s below.
# Here is that answer in Python 

# s = 'audacity'
    
    
#print 'U' + s[2:] 

# And here is the same answer in Ruby

s = 'audacity'

puts 'U' + s[2..-1]

#or

puts s[1..-1].capitalize

#or

puts s[1..8].capitalize
